Art forms such as Riot Grrl zines, DIY culture, and all-female bands created an anarcho-punk culture that coincided with third-wave feminist values of the time. Contrary to those who might argue that feminist punk is dead or has lost momentum since its surge in the ‘90s, scholarly work has shown that there is a strong existing presence of women in punk. By analyzing studies on gender politics within anarchist cultures, I argue that women’s voices in the anarcho-punk scene have existed and flourished in contemporary society with post-modern feminist tactics, despite efforts to drown them out inside and outside of anarcho-punk culture. I will look at zines, song lyrics, and public statements from different artists and bands including the popular feminist protest group from Russia, Pussy Riot. These artists have put women’s issues at the forefront in their anarcho-punk music and politics and therefore will enrich my study of women in punk. I will also analyze the existing literature on gender politics within anarcho-punk in an attempt to understand how women have used strategies of resistance to shape their identities in society and within punk culture.</p><h2 id="background-on-women-in-punk">Background on Women in Punk</h2><p>The role of women in punk began and flourished in the ‘70s-’90s with the rise of female musicians in rock bands and independent punk literature. In the United States, the Equal Opportunities Act and third-wave feminism created opportunities for women to participate in once non-traditional spaces to voice their political beliefs and frustrations with the gendering of society. Bands and artists of the time such as Patti Smith, Bikini Kill, Poison Girl and more, challenged these structural inequalities through anarchist principles. American philosopher Noam Chomsky defines anarchism as “a tendency that is suspicious and skeptical of domination, authority, and hierarchy. It seeks structures of hierarchy and domination in human life over the whole range, extending from, say, patriarchal families to, say, imperial systems, and it asks whether those systems are justified…” (as seen in Davis, 2019). Poison Girl uses this sentiment in their music with lyrics stating “Take the toys from the boys, take their hands off the guns” which challenges gender and masculine pride specifically (LeBlanc, 1999 p. 49). In the early ‘90s, Riot Grrrl emerged from the male-dominated punk cultures of the time as a new form of anarcho-punk. The Riot Grrrl Manifesto in the Bikini Kill Zine states: “We are angry at a society that tells us Girl = Dumb, Girl = Bad, Girl = Weak” (as seen in D'Angelica, 2009 pg. 2). Riot Grrrl and other feminist punks were concerned with the struggles surrounding women in US society including violence against women and the right to choose, although their approach differed from the mainstream political route with capitalist media (D'Angelica, 2009 pg. 2). Ultimately, this new subculture of anarcho-punk culture created a space for women to deconstruct notions of gender.</p><p>Although punk culture has changed since its heyday during the era of Patti Smith and Riot Grrrl, ‘DIY’ or ‘do it yourself' anarcho-punk culture has continued into the 21st century and evolved into a movement of many subcultures including anarcha-feminism with ethos generally coinciding with post-structural feminism. The internet has become a popular tool for independent artists and Zine creators to share new music and literary works. Large punk databases and websites act as outlets for people to independently publish their creative works of anarchist-ethos and feminist politics. Similar to anarcha-punk in the late-20th century, women have used creative expression to deconstruct social norms around identity politics through music, literature and other forms of art while also applying more intersectional feminist ideals to their work. I will later explore specific examples of these works in order to better understand the ways in which punk culture has continued and evolved to construct various identities in the 21st century.</p><h2 id="the-women-in-punk-toolkit">The Women in Punk Toolkit</h2><p>Women in contemporary punk cultures have learned and developed different tools to help them navigate spaces within and outside of masculine punk cultures. In a study of girls in punk subcultures, Lauraine LeBlanc argues that punk is still alive and that youth, in particular, are attracted to the anti-authority spirit and heavily contribute to the maintenance and development of punk (LeBlanc, 1999 pg. 34). Through in-depth ethnographic research, she goes into further detail about the ways in which these young women utilize tools of resistance against these oppressive behaviors and concludes that “girls in male­dominated youth subcultures such as punk continually confront ideologies of gender that remain largely invisible…gender is problematic for punk girls in a way that it is not for punk guys because punk girls must accommodate female gender within subcultural identities that are deliberately coded as made” (LeBlanc, 1999 pg. 9). LeBlanc provides insight into the various ways in which women are viewed within the punk culture and how they react to the gender dynamics to shape their own identities. This is important in understanding the difficulties women often face in male- dominated space. Although there are many women actively participating or eager to participate in punk culture, there are regularly occurring oppressive cultural limitations imposed by men in the form of overt and covert sexism and homophobia and must find creative ways to combat gender inequality.</p><p>Additionally, Leblanc points to ways in which adolescent women in punk internalize and conform to some of the gender norms of femininity and heterosexuality in order to feel as if they belong in the subculture and are accepted by the men (LeBlanc, 1999 pg. 105). These obstacles might help to explain why women are considered less visible in punk spaces. If women must minimize resistant ideology and behavior in order to be allowed to participate within a group, their presence will, in turn, be minimized within the anarcho-punk subculture. However, this is just one strategy women deploy while establishing themselves within punk culture and can help make sense of the complexities of gender politics within punk culture. Alternative strategies include vocally and physically negotiating between norms of masculinity and femininity and positioning themselves outside of mainstream cultures (LeBlanc, 1999 pg. 13). The concept of “tools of resistance” introduced by Leblanc, can be used to analyze recent anarcha-punk works in relation to their power struggles.</p><h2 id="punk-zines">Punk Zines</h2><p>When members of the ‘90s band Bratmobile and Bikini Kill started the Riot Grrrl movement, Molly Neuman, Allison Wolf, and others wrote an editorial statement as a tool to collectivize individuals towards a movement of solidarity amongst women in punk who were experiencing similar forms of sexist discrimination:“…there has been a proliferation of angry grrrrl zines in recent months, mainly due to the queezy feeling we girls get in our stomachs when we contemplate the general lack of girl power in society as a whole, and in the punk underground specifically” (as seen in Allen, 2011). This Riot Grrrl spirit exists to this day in the form of print and online Zine publications and can be seen in popular revolutionary corpuses such as CrimethInc.com and smaller-scale blogs such as “The Permission Factory”. In 2013, this blog was created to include a set of zines from queer people exploring gender and sexuality politics through a collective space that encouraged positive discourse and support for writers and readers. Creator of “The Permission Factory,” Scott Treleaven, explained his fascination with zines and motivation for the blog: “We’re a sextet of simultaneously emerging publications closely linked by our paradoxically uniform mix of paganism, sexual libertinism, cult aesthetics, anti- mainstream gay stance…that none of us have never met before, but were all compelled to enter a similar discourse, still amazes me” (Allen, 2011 pg. 143). Although zine culture has changed from the ’90s to present day—from their general topics of discussion to mode of communication—they both enact similar strategies of solidarity amongst participants in order to maintain and develop their anarcha-punk ethos. The collective efforts of ‘do it yourself’ culture is used as a key tool for punk women to unite against oppression.</p><p>Zines often arise out of frustration with specific events in contemporary society, such as the #MeToo movement, and serve as an alternative source to the mainstream media to talk about feminist issues. In a study of gender and post-structuralist, Lucy Nicolas argues that the anarcha- punk uses post-structuralist strategies of autonomy, self-empowerment or self-creation within zines and other punk outlets, which is then adapted to gender politics to transcend gender as a tyrannical, authoritarian discursive site of undesirable order (Nicholas, 2007 pg. 18). This can be seen in the Zine titled, “Fuck Abuse, Kill Power,” which looks at the compounding power structures that have impacted the law regarding sexual violence. The anonymous author writes:</p><blockquote><p>We have to weave together the ways that we respond to specific instances of sexual harassment and violence with a determination to confront and undermine the social order that gives rise to them. In every case of male violence, we should be clear that we are not dealing with an exception, but with a problem that is a structural feature of our society. At the same time, we need to create models of transformative justice that can replace the criminal justice system without replicating any feature of it, and to foster new ways of relating in which patriarchy, white supremacy, and other forms of authority do not determine the possibilities of our lives. Every person of every gender stands to gain from this. Let us join hands, teeth bared (9).</p></blockquote><p>This example illustrates the ways in which women in modern punk cultures use zines as a platform of autonomy, self-empowerment and self-creation. This anarcha-punk tool allows the author to express their frustrations with the wave of sexual violence in the past year and the issues with the criminal justice system as an ineffective means of solving the problem. The author also emphasizes the significance of spreading this message through outlets detached from capitalist media. This embodies the ‘do it yourself’ or ‘DIY’ ethic as the punk subcultures to create art that is separated from hierarchies and capitalist markets. Post-structural feminism works as a strategy to deconstruct gender norms within the anarcho-punk culture and mainstream society within these forms of expression. The zine also includes an image of a king gripping his sword while sitting in a burning throne with the caption “Patriarchy is not the bad behavior of a few specific men, but the framework of relations that fosters it.” The use of irony and other literary techniques within DIY culture shows how the constructed barriers of gender can be broken down through art. The ethos of autonomy and self-creation of DIY are thereby contingent on postmodern feminist and anarchist movements.</p><h2 id="punk-music">Punk Music</h2><p>Masculine-dominated punk subcultures can create toxic environments which exclude women from participation, forcing them to perform resistant strategies to gain access. In a study of women in punk music cultures in the UK, Naomi Griffin found that DIY punk music scene and leftist subcultures have ignored and sometimes contradicted the social progression of certain minority groups. Griffin argues the punk music scene acts as a natural space for the resistance to oppressive beliefs and institutions, however, masculine bodily performances might diminish the inclusive space that punk ethos aspires to create. For example, heavy metal music can encourage pushing, head-banging, and aggressive dance moves that are understood as more comfortable for men to perform than women (Griffin 2012). Bodily performances such as this might discourage women from attending punk music events out of fear of being injured or ostracized. Additionally, song lyrics of the bands in this ethnography often discussed leftist and anarchist political ideology on certain topics such as homophobia and racism, while simultaneously objectifying women in their songs and album images. This explains why some women might feel more uncomfortable in a punk music setting compared to men, which might help answer why there are fewer well-known female anarcho-punk bands, or why female bands often emphasize intersectional feminist politics in their lyrics. Because of this culture, it is necessary for women in punk music to use employ different tools in order to shape their identities within an anarcho- punk space.</p><p>An example of a contemporary band using resistant strategies within anachro-punk music to spread feminist ideals is the Russian, left-wing female group, Pussy Riot, who became widely known after performing “Punk Prayer” in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Political Science scholar Janet Johnson looks at Pussy Riot's “Punk Prayer” and other protest performances as a reaction to the Kremlin's masculinity-based nation-rebuilding scheme, which was a cover for homophobic ideology (Johnson 2014). Although Pussy riot is responding to a different feminist context based on their country’s hierarchies and forms of oppression, their anarchist ethos can be analyzed as a cross-cultural technique to position themselves outside of mainstream culture. This can also be seen in their 2018 song “Bad Girls” which says: “Good girls working at the banks; Bad girls blowing up the tanks; Good Girls pray to a man with a beard; But God is a woman and she’s deaf and she’s queer; Good girls are waiting on the kings; And the bad girls are laughing;‘Cause they know he’s a dick.” Pussy Riot challenges notions of femininity by comparing traditional gender roles to an anarcha-feminist ideology. This strategy works to break down constructions of identity by ironically comparing “bad girls,” who challenge authority to “good girls,” who remain subjected to gender norms. It also critiques the hierarchies of religious authority and sexuality in Russia. With anarchist sentiment of anti- authoritarianism and anti-capitalism, Pussy Riot uses musical protest to counter gender stereotypes and break down structural inequality in anarcho-punk and mainstream society.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>My research shows anarchist sentiment has coincided with anarcho-punk subcultures where women are foregrounded to voice their opinions and critiques of gendered society. Women have continued to hold active and prominent roles in the anarcho-punk scene since the ‘70s despite the presence of dominating masculinity in societies and subcultures that attempt to drown them out. Because of the nature of anarchist philosophy, sexism exists less prevalent in anarcho-punk subcultures than in mainstream society, but it is difficult to completely detach an entire subculture from a hegemonic society where gender norms frame the way we navigate throughout life. It is important for future research to have an intersectional approach when analyzing anarcha-feminism and punk culture to provide a better understanding of women in punk in the modern-day and how it has progressed since the 20th-century.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><h4 id="secondary-sources">Secondary Sources</h4><p>Allen, G.
