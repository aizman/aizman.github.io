On March 20th, 2003, the Bush administration launched an attack on Iraq without the approval of the U.N., legitimating its decision on the basis of hidden weapons of mass destruction. During the 1980’s, Washington supplied Iraq’s dictator Saddam Hussein with intelligence, aid, and whatever arms he desired (Murray, Scales Jr. 27). However, this friendship quickly ended in a post-September 11 world, when the Bush administration’s militaristic turn in foreign policy put human rights on the backburner and exacerbated the pain of war for civilian Iraqis without being able to loosen Saddam’s iron grip (Murray, Scales Jr. 33; Tarrow 10). U.S. leaders—politicians, military experts, and intelligence analysts did all in their power to “sell” the war to the American public and suppressed the voices of protest (Tarrow 10). The Iraq War had partially been driven by the United States’ capitalistic interests, since Iraq had the greatest oil reserves of any nation after Saudi Arabia (Murray, Scales Jr. 19). Disillusioned with the lies from their government, anarcho-punk youth grabbed their guitars and wrote anti- war songs, mobilizing Americans to take political action. I argue that the punk subculture of the early 2000’s contained anarchist principles in the countercultural, decentralized production networks, collectivization methods, and direct action politics that mobilized youth.</p><p>Many anti-war songs evoke anger in order to make listeners question authority. Punk is frequently caricatured by its evocative embrace of rage and violence, and as NPR radio host Rick Karr noted, as long as there have been songs in America, there have been protest songs (2003). Author Kevin Dunn gives an account of his own experience at a punk club in Portland, Oregon a few blocks from his hotel when the U.S. was invading Iraq. Popular anti-war songs of the time contained variations of the phrase “blood for oil” in every chorus. Dunn recalls hearing lyrics such as “Don’t give me no shit about blood, sweat, tears and toil / It’s all about the price of oil” and “We need healthcare more than going to war / You think it’s democracy they’re fighting for? / Bush and Saddam should kick it like back in the day / With the cocaine and Courvoisier.” The in-between song banter reflected comments about President George W. Bush, remarks about American fascism, concerns about the impending War on Iraq, and pleas to register to vote (Dunn 194). The bands were using the hard, angry music to make sense of the dangerous world they found themselves in and helped young consumers become critical of the world they are inheriting. Listening to punk was an inspiring experience through which one can quickly learn about the secrets behind the Iraq War. Author Dylan Clark argues that punks, frustrated with the social and political repression of contemporary life, turned to punk rock and directed their anger at the “System,” or “sexist, homophobic, racist, and ecocidal corporate capitalism which dominates people” (56). In its anti-capitalistic tendencies, the punk movement embodied anarchism and became an important device for disrupting the pro-war status quo. One of the elements that made punk significant was that it represented not just a form of musical expression, but a social and political disruption giving artists freedom to express themselves. Punk provided resources for disruption of the orderly sequence involved in the communication of dominant social ideas and practices, such as the pro-war narratives in the media. It can disrupt the authorized codes through which the social world is organized and experienced. The basic tenets of punk have always been: no set of rules, no set of expectations, and that it always challenges the status quo (Dunn 197). As we will see, the expectations for the music industry were set by a centralized authority figure.</p><p>Due to anti-war messages being blacklisted on the radio, the punk subculture fought against media conglomerates by creating alternative avenues to spread its message. Punk offered a healthy resistance to dominant forces and social norms, whatever they may be, and this message was conveyed not just in the lyrics of punk music, but in the entirety of punk. During the anti-Vietnam War movement in the 1970s, as NPR host Rick Karr explains, record companies and radio broadcasters could embrace songs with anti-war messages, but that freedom has evaporated as media conglomerates have taken over the record and radio industries and shunned anything that might alienate even one listener (2003). Capitalist media firms did not invest in young musicians who wrote protest songs because they had to sell records and time on the radio stations (Karr 2003). In response to this media censorship, the punk movement’s do-it- yourself (DIY) ethos demanded that listeners move beyond the role of consumers and instead become actively involved by distributing self-produced zines, organizing shows (often in atypical venues, such as basements of houses), or starting their own bands (a frequently cited excerpt from an early punk zine, for example, contains a diagram of three guitar chords and features the caption, “Now Form a Band”) (Barrett 26). Punks strove to eliminate the distinctions between performers and audience, and did so by the anarchist principle of egalitarianism: anyone could be a punk, and any punk could play in a band, publish a zine, organize shows, or produce or distribute records. An anti-establishment, decentralized disposition is the defining anarchist element of the genre. The movement itself has offered no established leadership to be co-opted, either by big business or political parties. In response to big companies silencing anti-war messages, punk culture deconstructed and subverted the social order of radio air-time and parodied the position of a CEO. By finding a more productive and less destructive way of fighting against the status quo, punk rock works within and against the hegemony of capitalist telecommunication networks. Rather than protesting to gain access to dominant institutions, organizers built their own alternatives. In other words, punk culture is anti-hierarchical and cooperative, functioning as a relatively autonomous space in society and providing musicians with resources for agency and empowerment. Against the rise of neoliberalism which aimed to destroy the very idea of communal spaces, punk rock sought to carve out a space that was closed to the market and controlled by the community that used it. Along with the basic tenet of decentralization, the early 2000’s punk subculture contained the anarchist principle of collectivization. Anarchism has historically been a pronounced feature of the punk field as evidenced by various anarcho-punk collectives (Dunn 200). Punk can be linked to the anarchist New Left inspired organization of cooperative counter-institutions that began in the late 1960s (Barrett 25). From the 1960s onward, collectives such as cooperative bookstores, coffee shops, and grocery stores began to spring up and were organized according to three basic principles: consensus-based decision-making, voluntary participation, and relatively horizontal leadership structures (Barrett 25). The punk movement as a whole has thrived under a network of local “scenes” with no central authority. In their collectives they not only organize concerts and promote punk music but have their own workshops for study, analysis, and political education (Dunn 208). The collectivist impulses led members of the punk subculture to do significant organizational work, not only confronting dominant power structures but also proving less isolated from the rest of society than they are often presented. Instead of petitioning the powerful for inclusion, the punk movement has built its own elaborate network of counter- structures, including music venues, media, record labels, and distributors that have operated as cultural and economic alternatives to the entertainment industry and sites of resistance to the Iraq War.</p><p>Notable punk bands that were against the Iraq War used their bombastic lyrics to mobilize youth for the anarchist principle of direct action. Green Day’s album American Idiot is a pointed political critique of the George W. Bush administration and contemporary American life, and the band combined their performances with calls for political action and involvement among the audiences. As an example, the band would regularly pull members of the audience on stage, hand them instruments, teach them a few chords, and have them join the band in a cover of Operation Ivy’s anti-war song ‘Unity’ (Dunn 202). The fact that Green Day signed to a major media corporation and still retained their anti-status quo disposition exposed a greater expanse of youth to an alternative point of view that they are not necessarily going to hear on the news or from their parents. Green Day’s high profile benefit for Food Not Bombs raised $500,000 to feed homeless (Dunn 204). High-profile punk bands have the resources to resist neoliberal hegemony while also providing a means to directly give back to the community. NOFX released a scathing critique of the Bush administration with their American Errorist CD. The lead singer created punkvoter.com with the ultimate goal to educate, register and mobilize over 500,000 youths to be an electoral force (Dunn 208). This exemplifies the fact that punk offers the possibility for activism when the personal is political. While there are no punk politics per se, punk can produce a disposition that is inherently political in nature. The DIY ethos and anarchist sympathies within punk provide valuable resources for political engagement that is both local and disturbing to pro- war advocates. Punk rock has always been on the edge and in the forefront of politics. Punk, as a youth culture that nurtures a healthy skepticism of authority, serves as a stepping stone towards more formal political activism. Punk’s direct, participatory nature of DIY politics constituted a direct action approach to politics—a congruence of “means and ends.” Punk is about getting involved, not tuning in and dropping out. Youth respond to their environment with proactive organization. DIY punk ventures necessitate the development of basic organizing skills, such as designing and distributing flyers, monitoring crowds, and negotiating with police and neighbors (Barrett 38). Punk’s DIY ethos and the resource it offers for resisting the multiple forms of alienation in modern society is a key tenet of anarchist direct action politics. For the youth involved, the word punk is a synonym of struggle and commitment. It energized disenfranchised youths in the Bush-era and mobilized them to make a change a reality.</p><p>The punk subculture must then be credited, at least to some extent, to the large number of protesters during the global anti-Iraq war movement. On February 15, 2003, millions of people around the world combined in the largest example of collective action in history to protest against the impending war on Iraq (Tarrow 7). The Institute for Policy Studies, a collection of scholar-activists, wrote a piece on how across the globe, the call came in scores of languages, ‘the world says no to war!’ and the cry ‘Not in Our Name’ echoed from millions of voices (Bennis 2013). The Guinness Book of World Records said between 12 and 14 million people came out that day, the largest protest in the history of the world (Bennis 2013). It was, as British labor and peace activist Tony Benn described it to the million Londoners in the streets that day, ‘the first global demonstration, and its first cause is to prevent a war against Iraq’ (Bennis 2013). Interestingly, this event was a global protest against a war that had not yet begun — the goal, to try to stop it. While we did not prevent the Iraq war, the protests proved its clear illegality, demonstrated the isolation of the Bush administration policies, helped prevent war in Iran, and inspired a generation of activists (Bennis 2013). As one speaker at the event noted, ‘We stand here today because our right to dissent, and our right to participate in a real democracy has been hijacked by those who call for war’ (Bennis 2013). It was something new in the history of contentious politics yet also drawn from anarchist principles: a concerted campaign of transnational collective action—using means of mobilization—which brought millions of people together around common goals and against common targets. In a way, the anarchist anti-war sympathies within punk DIY culture spread from local scenes into global networks that reached millions, one of punk music’s biggest successes.</p><p>To conclude, early 2000’s DIY punk music began from anger and disillusionment about the Iraq War, then made into full records, then performed for friends, that then led to a wider direct action movement. Punk music during this era was anarchist in that it took a decentralized route of distributing its anti-war message, straying away from big media corporations. The angry, in-your-face lyrics helped fuel collectivist organization as a way of expressing resentment towards the Bush administration's war on terror, the Iraq War, and the negative effects of globalization and neoliberalism. Through connecting anger in music to anger in street protests, punk music changed many people’s consciousness about what was happening and shaped American culture. Punk has always been about asking “why” and then doing something about it. It is about looking at the world around and asking “Why are things as fucked up as they are?” And then it’s about looking inwards at yourself and asking “Why aren’t I doing anything about this?”</p><h2 id="works-cited">Works Cited</h2><p>Barrett, Dawson. <a href="www.jstor.org/stable/41809730">“DIY Democracy: The Direct Action Politics of U.S. Punk Collectives.”</a> <em>American Studies,</em> vol. 52, no. 2, 2013, pp. 23–42.
